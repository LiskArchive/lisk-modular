## Modules

Modules are individual building blocks for the lisk. The implementation of each module is up-to user but by default it should generate an object with this structure. 

```js
// Exported as main file to javascript package
 export default {
    /**
    * A unique module name accessed through out the system.
    * If some module already registered with same alias, it will throw error
    */
    alias: 'moduleName',
    
    /**
     * Package detail referring the version and other details
     * Easiest way is to directly refer to package.json for all details
     */ 
    pkg: require('../package.json'),
    
    /**
    * Supported configurations for the module with default values 
    */ 
    defaults: { },
    
    /**
    * List of valid events which this module want to register with the controller
    * Each event name will be prefixed by module alias, e.g. moduleName:event1
    * Listing event means to register a valid event in the eco-system
    * Any module can subscribe or publish that event in the eco-system
    */  
    events: [],
    
    /**
    * List of valid actions which this module want to register with the controller
    * Each action name will be prefixed by module alias, e.g. moduleName:action1
    * Action definition can be provided on module load with the help of the channels
    * Source module can define the action while others can invoke that action 
    */ 
    actions: [],
    
    /**
    * Method which will be invoked by controller to load the module 
    * make sure all loading logic get completed during the life cycle of load.
    * Controller emit an event `lisk:ready` which you can use to perform 
    * some activities which you want to perform when every other module is loaded 
    * 
    * @param {Channel} channel - An interface to channel  
    * @param {Object} options - An object of module options
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
    load: async (channel, options) => {},
    
    /**
    * Method to be invoked by controller to perform the cleanup 
    * 
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
    unload: async () => {},
}
```
